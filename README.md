# Project: SlingAir!

<img src='frontend/src/assets/screenshots/header.png' style='width:100%' />
Slingair was a seat booking app project for Concordiaâ€™s full stack web development bootcamp. We were provided with some assets and an incomplete frontend. The goal of the project was to fix the frontend, hook it up to a Node.JS backend and migrate the data in `backend/data.js` to a brand-new MongoDB database in order to obtain an MVP. The server endpoints were made to be RESTful.

## The App

### Functionality

- When a user navigates to `http://localhost:3000`, they are presented with an input to enter the flight number.

- With the flight number, make a request to the server for the seating availability on that flight.

- When a response with seating is received, display the seating input as well as the form requesting user's information.

- User selects a seat, enters information and clicks 'Confirm'.

- Contact the server with the data, and wait for a success response to redirect to the `/confirmed` page.
- The confirmed page should display a confirmation message to the user with the info that they entered on the previous screen.

### Backend

1. Server endpoints are RESTful.
2. There are endpoints for the following actions:
   - retrieve all flight numbers
   - retrieve single flight data (seating)
   - retrieve all reservations
   - retrieve a single reservation
   - create a reservation
   - delete a reservation 
   - update a reservation 
3. server should respond in a complete fashion.
   - Send the status and the json separately.
   - send the status in the json object as well.
   - when a request succeeds respond with requested `data`.
   - when a request fails, respond with the `data` that was sent to the server.
   - when a request does not need any data to be returned, provide a message explaining the status: i.e. "reservation deleted."

```js
res.status(200).json({ status: 200, data: {}, message: {} });
```
